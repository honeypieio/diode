Diode allows organisations to test their electricals easily. 

Each type of item has a related set of procedures which take the user through how to conduct the test step by step.

Each user has to be granted permission to carry out each procedure - this ensures that only people qualified can test; and that all records of said testing are consistent, correct and available anywhere.
